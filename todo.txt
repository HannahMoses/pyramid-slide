To do :
A "slider" is actually just an <input> whose type attribute is equal to "range". See here for more details.
The slider event that you care about is oninput. See here for more details.
Remember that a dropdown menu is just a <select> element with some <option> elements nested inside.
The select event that you care about is onchange.
You will need to use the following style attributes: 
margin, padding, color, background-color, border, border-radius, font-size, font-weight
